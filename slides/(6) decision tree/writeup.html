<h1>Supervised Learning</h1>

Let's say the ask is to predict whether a loan application will be 'approved' or 'disapproved'.

What attributes loan application might contain:
1. age
2. salary
3. years of experience
4. other loans
5. cibil score

In supervised learning, you have a history of previous applications where you also know the result.

Based on this data, you have to predict if an new incoming application would be approved or disapproved.
